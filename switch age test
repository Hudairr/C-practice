#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int age = 42;
    switch (age) {
        case 16:
            cout << "Too young";
            break;
        case 42:
            cout << "Adult";
            break;
        case 70:
            cout << "Senior";
            break;
    }

    return 0;
}

As you can see, the program executed the matching case statement, printing "Adult" to the screen. 
With no specified break statement, the statements continued to run after the matching case. 
Thus, all the other case statements printed. This type of behavior is called fall-through.
